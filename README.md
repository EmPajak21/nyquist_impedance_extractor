# Data-Driven Impedance Extraction from Experimental Nyquist Plots ðŸ§ª

This script quickly ingests and processes Nyquist plot experimental data, using curve-fitting minimisations to estimate the impedance in ohms (Î©).

## Quick Start ðŸš€

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   Make sure you have Python installed, and install the necessary packages by running:
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run Script & Provide Data**:
 
   Run the script and enter the Excel file name containing the experimental data when prompted.

4. **Get Results:**

   The script will output the estimated impedance and also generate a plot showing the experimental data and the fitted circle.
